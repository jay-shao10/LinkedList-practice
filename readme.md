This is a practice of LinkedList

with mainly five operations

1. add a new node to the linkedlist
2. return the length of the linkedlist
3. finding the index of the giving value, return is a list, because there might be duplicate value in the linkedlist
4. remove linkedlist node by giving index
5. remove linkedlist node by giving value, if there are duplicate value, it will remove the first one
